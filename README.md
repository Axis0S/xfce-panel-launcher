### Simple Build (Recommended)

Use the simple Makefile:

```bash
mkdir m4
xdt-autogen
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
```

## Installation

### System-wide Installation (Recommended)

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

This installs the plugin to the system directories:
- Plugin library: `/usr/lib/xfce4/panel/plugins/`
- Desktop file: `/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/`

### Local User Installation

For testing without sudo privileges:

```bash
make
make install-local
```

This installs to your user directory (`~/.local/lib/xfce4/panel/plugins/`).

## Usage

1. After installation, restart XFCE Panel:
   ```bash
   xfce4-panel -r
   ```

2. Right-click on your XFCE panel and select "Panel" â†’ "Add New Items..."

```

```

## Customization

The plugin uses GTK CSS for styling. You can modify the appearance by editing the CSS in the source code (`xfce-launcher.c`).

## Troubleshooting

If the plugin doesn't appear after installation:

1. Make sure XFCE Panel is restarted: `xfce4-panel -r`
2. Check if the plugin files are in the correct location:
   - System installation:
     - Plugin library: `/usr/lib/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
   - Local installation:
     - Plugin library: `~/.local/lib/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `~/.local/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
3. Run XFCE Panel in debug mode to see any errors: `xfce4-panel -q && PANEL_DEBUG=1 xfce4-panel`
