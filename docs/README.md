## Installation

### System-wide Installation (Recommended)

## Troubleshooting

If the plugin doesn't appear after installation:

1. Make sure XFCE Panel is restarted: `xfce4-panel -r`
2. Check if the plugin files are in the correct location:
   - System installation (Debian/Ubuntu):
     - Plugin library: `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
   - System installation (other distributions):
     - Plugin library: `/usr/lib/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
   - Local installation:
     - Plugin library: `~/.local/lib/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `~/.local/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
3. Run XFCE Panel in debug mode to see any errors: `xfce4-panel -q && PANEL_DEBUG=1 xfce4-panel`
