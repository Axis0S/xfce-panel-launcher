xfce4-panel-launcher for Debian
-------------------------------

The xfce4-panel-launcher package provides a modern, full-screen application 
launcher plugin for the XFCE Panel, inspired by macOS Launchpad.

What is XFCE Launcher Plugin?

This plugin transforms the XFCE desktop experience by providing a visually 
appealing and efficient way to access all installed applications. When 
activated from the panel, it displays a full-screen overlay showing all 
your applications in an organized grid layout.

Usage
-----

After installation, the plugin appears as "Application Launcher" in the 
XFCE Panel's "Add New Items" dialog. Once added to the panel, clicking 
the launcher icon opens the full-screen application grid. Users can:

- Browse applications visually in the grid
- Start typing to search for specific applications
- Right-click applications to access additional options

The plugin is designed to be intuitive and requires no configuration to 
start using. It automatically discovers all installed applications from 
standard system locations.
